## Using Maven to Install dependencies

ON MAC:

First we need to install maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

Then we need to add Maven to PATH variable

run 'mvn -v' to verify that it has installed and been added to your Path correctly


The required dependencies for Mockito, JUnit and Log4J are defined in pom.xml, located at /TestingProject/pom.xml.  In IntelliJ, go to either Build > Build project or Build > Rebuild Project.  

Once Maven downloads the dependencies, they will be located at 'External Libraries' in the Project Explorer.  If they still aren't downloading, right click on the project, go to 'Add framework support...', and click 'Maven'
